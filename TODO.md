- [x] Write tests for image cube operations on actual data.
- [x] Implement a STAC object creator.
- [x] Write down a detailed document on data parsing and other things.
- [ ] Write out a proper paper on band experiments and what they mean before doing any thing else.
- [ ] Write out a detailed document on Gaussian Mixture Models
- [x] Write out a utility function to convert the DNs in Prisma to usable values and document the process.
- [x] Utility function to generate a robust validity mask that operates at the voxel level.
- [ ] Workout patch data model.
- [ ] Dataset Builder impl for Landsat data. be very careful about masking, because masks are native to rasterio read. Cloud detection is also needed.
- [ ] full visual confirmation that the dataset builder is working as expected.
