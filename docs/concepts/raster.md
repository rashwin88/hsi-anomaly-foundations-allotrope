## What is a raster file?

We often encounter the term raster file in the context of satellite data. It will be useful to know what it is and how it is different from a hyperspectral file.
A raster file is a data structure made up of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (a grid). It is typically 2 dimensional with a limited number of bands. A hyperspectral file is a special type of raster that expands the number of bands signficantly. *Each pixel has a complete spectral signature*.
